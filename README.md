# flask-project
Example CRUD project using **Flask**, **MongoDB** and **JWT Authentication**, developed for studying purposes

# About
This project was initially developed as part of Alura's Flask course, where the goal was creating an API REST.
After completing the course, the project evolved, developing the API into a web application with an HTML and CSS interface, integrating frontend and backend within the same application.
- Why the change?
As mentioned, wanted to develop my skills and practice what i've learned at this point
